# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. The comments in your readme are very helpful! It's clear that you re-scoped your project early on to focus on getting an MVP
and then adding features after you got something working. In the future, it would be nice to see a Trello board with evidence of your user stories being
in current, backlog, or icebox lists.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. My only recommendation for improving re: technical requirements would be to think of a way to let the user choose the number of tiles.
Even if the limit is what you currently have, there are opportunities to reduce code complexity by storing this information in an array of objects rather
than hardcoding the boxes and their numbers in the index.html file. Other than that, I am impressed with your project! nice job.


## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Your variable names and overall code organization are great. In the future, please remove unused/commented out code. Also, there
are a few places where you manually reference indexes of the cards. I recommend using a loop to generate these indexes so you won't have to update your
javascript should you change the number of tiles your game displays at the start.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Again, *excellent* comments in your readme! This will be useful to review as you go into Project 2 and/or an interview
where they ask you to explain your code/process. I would like to see you continue working on the arbitrary number of tiles implementation - let me know
if you'd like to work through this together!

Overall, great job on project 1!
